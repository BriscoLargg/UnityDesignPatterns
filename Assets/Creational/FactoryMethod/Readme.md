Notes: 

### Structure

1. Factory: The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. Itâ€™s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.
```
    public interface IFactory
    {
        IProduct Create();
    }
```
2. Product: The Product declares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.
```
    public interface IProduct
    {
    }
```
3. Concrete Factories: Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.
```
    public class FactoryA : IFactory
    {
        public IProduct Create()
        {
            return new ProductA();
        }
    }

    public class FactoryB : IFactory
    {
        public IProduct Create()
        {
            return new ProductB();
        }
    }
```
4. Concrete Products: Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface.
```
    public class ProductA : IProduct
    {
    }

    public class ProductB : IProduct
    {
    }
```
